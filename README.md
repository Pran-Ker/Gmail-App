## Gmail Beautify

This is an extremely simple way to customize the way you send emails. The aim of this repo is to help you guys to set the default of your email to a custom html page of your choice. Attached in this repo is my version. Feel free to use this as a template and change it to your desire. So, let's get on with it.

### Steps:
Follow along :
1. Pick/ create an static html page of your choice. However, keep in mind that Gmail has a character limit of 10,000 characters, so don't exceed that. *The first time my template did that is why there are no spaces. ** Make sure if any images are stored there is a link to that.
2. Login to your Gmail or other email service (that provides signatures).
3. Goto Settings > General > Go down till signature .
4. Add "****". This will make it easier later on.
5. Go on Inspect Elements.
6. Search in the Gmail page's html for the "****" that you had previously inserted.
7. Copy and paste the html static page chosen in place holder (where the "****" are)
8. Save the signature.
9. Try it out by creating a new email
10. To Enter details just click and type in like normal.

*** Sometimes bugs are encountered, while adding text, and other media or documents. This can be fixed by switching off the signature for that email.
